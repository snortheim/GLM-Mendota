# 2013/10/04
# Version 1.3.2
#
# Since glm_1.3.1
#
# Added support for sub daily in plotting
# Changed handling of diagnostics vars to be as if they were time_treatment_last.
#   This is because they do not get appropriately resized when layers do
# Changed name of do_settle flag to mobility_off
# Small correction to how start date is initialised
# Put back program name for plot window
# Moved do_fabm to be after all layer resizing so output better reflects what was there when fabm ran
# Added support for plotting extc and density
# Changed z-scale labels to be sideways and allow for < 0.01 maxima/minima
#
#
# 2013/09/22
# Version 1.3.1
#
# Since glm_1.3.0
#
# Fixed a problem where if fabm is not used require inflow variables to be limited to 3 (flow,temp,salt)
# Added a version watermark to the plots
# Fixed Thermocline depth responding opposite to expected when Kw adjusted.
#  Solution: New code in glm_surface.c to avoid doubling up of surface energy due to PAR.
#  Note change to glm_model.c to recalculate the light at the surface layer.
# Fixed GLM extremely sensitive to choice of bsn_len_outl and bsn_wid_outl and users most often
#   use the default in Testsim2 rather than the actual values for their lake.
#  Solution: remove all reference to these parameters replace with a calculation based on a) the
#   area of the lake at that layer; b) the area of an ellipse; and c) the ratio of bsn_len to bsn_wid at
#   the crest.  The modified code affects both do_mixing and outflows.
# Fixed GLM creating energy in do_mixer leaving lakes 2-5oC too hot.
#  Solution: When combining layers in kelvin_helmoltz must recalculate density and set both layers to be the same.
# Added version stamp support to libplot.
# Fixed problem with save all-in-1 not getting rows right if not exact multiple of columns
# Changed phytoplankton diagnositic variables to be time_treatment_last
# Added support for plotting Radiation
#
#
# 2013/08/08
# Version 1.3.0
#
# Since glm_1.2.2
#
# FABM core updated
# Rewritten the settling - now called mobility to handle non-uniform direction of motion
# Fixed a problem with light not fading correctly
# Modified the restrictive ordering requirement on inflow FABM variables order - now should be as in glm.nml
# Corrected the WIN32 preprocessor flag to _WIN32
# minor update to csv reading to support ALM
# some addition for for support for single precision version
# plotting no longer needs temp and salinity first
# Added mixing parameter coef_mix_hyp (efficiency of hypolimnetic mixing)
#
#
# 2013/05/17
# Version 1.2.2
#
# Since glm_1.2.1
#
# Allow layer 0 to be in the "levels output"
# Fixed a bug of incorrect sediment heating
#
#
# 2013/05/02
# Version 1.2.1
#
# Since glm_1.2.0
#
# Fixed a bug where timefmt that doesnt need "stop" field would crash if it wasn't included
# Fixed check of floating offtake being in the right range.
#
#
# 2013/04/12
# Version 1.2.0
#
# Since glm_1.1.0
#
# changed meaning of "Depths" in "init_profiles" to really be depths, and added a new
#  parameter "lake_depth" to be the total depth of the lake. To use the old meaning
#  you must change "num_depths" and "the_depths" to "num_heights" and "the_heights" respectively
# mixing bugfixes
#  changed some config paramters
#
#   coef_mix_kinetic => coef_mix_conv
#   coef_mix_eta     => coef_wind_stir
#   coef_mix_cs      => coef_mix_shear
#   coef_mix_ct      => coef_mix_turb
#
# added check for unknown entries in namelist file
# added checks to H and A from "morphometry"
#
#            ---------------------------------------------
#
# 2013/03/13
# Version 1.1.0
#
# Since glm_1.0.1C
#
# upgraded to latest fabm
# fixed a problem in zooplankton
# fixed a problem where layer thicknesses output were > than max_layer_ht
# modified evap equations to be self consistant.
# modified csv and namelist readers to allow for possiblility of blank lines or stray
#   windows style end of line markers.
# corrected output which was missing the top layer of data (except for WQ values)
# corrected wind output to .nc file to be factored with wind_factor
# modified output so lake.csv is written daily and now includes daily Rain and Evap
# corrected to inflow outflow rates reported in lake.csv file to account for "factor"
# fixed a bug in outflow which put the effective outflow above the lake (for non-zero base_elev)
# corrected floating outflow to rest on the bottom rather than sink below bottom if lake is too deep
# Added fudge factor to allow for lakes briefly being deeper than crest allows
#
#            ---------------------------------------------
#
# 2013/02/18
# Version 1.0.1C
#
# Since glm_1.0.0C
#
# remove base_elev and crest_elev from config
# fixed bug in namelist reader where integers in a REAL list would not appear in the list
# fixed bug where max layers was checked for validity before that was possible leading to crashes 
#   if the lake was deeper than maxlayers could allow.
# fixed bug that would crash is lake was deeper than 100m.
#
#            ---------------------------------------------
#
# 2012/12/12
# Version 1.0.0C
# Translated to C
#
#            ---------------------------------------------
#
# Since glm_20121003

#   in the initial conditions
